There’s no doubt about it, living in Santa Cruz is more expensive than other parts of the country and even other parts of California.  However, some of the information that has been shared in news stories and social media misrepresents the actual facts and figures.

First and foremost, it’s important to understand that all information about costs are readily available on our website. Graduate students can access this information via [the admissions FAQ page which links to student budgets](https://financialaid.ucsc.edu/cost-to-attend/graduate-costs.html).  From that page, more specific information about rental rates based on Housing and Urban Development data can be found [on the UCOP website](https://www.ucop.edu/student-affairs/_files/housing-costs-near-campuses.pdf).  This page provides campus to campus comparisons and also “strongly encourages prospective students and their families to consider how their own costs might differ from those given in the estimates.” 

The HUD housing estimate of **$2,042** for a one-bedroom closely aligns with publicly available information.  It also demonstrates how shared housing can have a significant impact in reducing rent burden.

## Why does the HUD number differ so much from the average that has been reported in news stories and social media?

It’s important to keep in mind that the Rent Café average rental price of $2611 reported in news and social media is not for a one bedroom.  Instead, it represents ALL rental units regardless of number of bedrooms (1, 5, or more).  

Another problem with averages, is that they do not to take into account the quality of the rental which is why the most recent census data for city and county of Santa Cruz returns much lower averages:
 
|  | Santa Cruz |  Cost Per Person |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| 1 bedroom |  $1,359 |  $1,359 |
| 2 bedrooms |  $1,903 |  $952 |
| 3 bedrooms |  $2,046 |  $682 |
| 4 bedrooms |  $1,824 |  $456 |

**Bottom line**—beware of averages when trying to understand the Santa Cruz market.  A better tool for understanding rental rates is a median like that reported by Rentometer which recently returned $2034 for a one bedroom in Santa Cruz—a number more in line with the HUD estimates on which the university relies.

## Near-Term Solutions

Even with a better understanding of the costs, it is still clear that Santa Cruz is one of the more expensive campuses in the UC system.  This is an issue for which there are no easy answers; one that our campus has been struggling with for many years—at times with more success than others.  

Recognizing that the short-term challenge needs to be addressed while we focus on longer-term solutions, Chancellor Larive in January announced two new programs to provide doctoral and MFA students with greater financial security and predictability:

- **5-year/50% Support Packages:** Beginning in fall 2020, UCSC will offer new and continuing doctoral students support packages for five years (two?? years for MFA students). These packages will have a minimum level of support equivalent to that of a 50 percent teaching assistantship.
- **$2500 Need-Based Housing Supplement:** Until more graduate student housing becomes available, a need-based, annual housing supplement for doctoral and MFA students offered through a partnership between the Financial Aid Office and the Graduate Division.  Most 

Together, these programs cost approximately $7 million per year are being paid for through a reduction in funding for other campus programs and resources.

- **Temporary Housing Assistance Programs:** As both of those programs are slated to begin in fall, Chancellor Larive also introduced a bridge measure to support students who need help now. Offered through Slug Support, these programs help cover gaps in rent and other housing related costs as well as providing security deposit assistance.
