## Undergraduates

It has been said that the grade strike is a "victimless" action. However, when students do not have grades, it can have a profound, and perhaps unexpected, impact on student success including:

### Loss of Financial Aid
The Department of Education (DOE) requires verification of student academic progress. If the Financial Aid and Scholarship Office’s (FASO) cannot verify a student’s eligibility, financial aid must be adjusted (decreased) and funds returned leaving students responsible for the difference. Moreover, while the FASO will make all attempts to reinstate a financial aid award once the grades are submitted, in some cases, depending on individual factors including the type of aid involved, the reduction in aid may be irreversible.

### Enrollment Difficulties
Missing grades, and the resulting lack of credits, can impact a student’s prerequisites, academic standing, and even their ability to enroll in a course restricted to their class level (i.e., senior seminar). Likewise, a lack of credits—resulting from missing grades—can impact a student’s position during enrollment possibly impacting their ability to get into more popular classes.

### Ability to Apply for Graduation
Without grades, some students may not be able to successfully apply for graduation. The Office of the Registrar may not be able to grant a degree for a student who is missing a grade. Additionally, missing grades prohibit the determination of whether a student qualifies for any academic honors.

### Ability to Declare a Major
Students with missing grades may not be able to declare a major by the February 7 deadline.

### Timely Transcript Receipt
Without grades, the Office of the Registrar will be unable to provide a complete transcript which may impact applications to transfer, graduate school, external programs or external scholarships.

Students who want any missing grades should reach out to their course instructor. Students who wish to notify the campus about a class or section disruption are able to do so with [an online form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfp3sz6yAzWFuvZBdUNUlYyS8x8IwSkckOGePB5v6IMmHlTBw/viewform). The form can be used multiple times.

## Students participating in the unsanctioned strike

All students who have continued to withhold fall grades have until 11:59 p.m. on Friday, February 21 to submit all missing grades, to end the strike and to fulfill their contractual obligations. The campus is giving these students one final opportunity to fulfill their teaching responsibilities and show that they can fulfill future responsibilities. Those who do not submit full grade information by February 21 will not receive spring quarter appointments or will be dismissed from their spring quarter appointments.

 Students alleged to have deleted grades have received student conduct summonses.

## Cost of Safety

UC Santa Cruz has 10,000 people living on campus which includes students,  families with children, and people with medical conditions. The campus has a responsibility to make sure that its community members and emergency vehicles can enter and exit the campus safely. The campus heard from many people who were blocked from entering campus because of the picketing. 

UC Santa Cruz police officers and those who come in to provide aid are well-trained and work to de-escalate situations whenever possible. UC Santa Cruz is committed to the safety of everyone in our community including the students who are currently choosing to disrupt access to the campus. The police presence is not meant to be threatening or to cause distress, but to ensure safety for everyone.
