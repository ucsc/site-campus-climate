For those who may be unfamiliar, graduate degrees fall generally into two types—a Master’s or Professional degree and Doctorate or “Terminal” degree. Most non-doctoral degrees are not terminal in academic terms, with the exception of the Master of Fine Arts (MFA). The MFA is an academically recognized terminal degree and is given to practitioners in the fine arts and performing arts.
 
While Master’s and Professional degrees tend to be self-funding, terminal degree candidates at Santa Cruz are often funded through some combination of Teaching Assistantship and Graduate Student Researchship. These academic apprentice positions provide the largest source of UCSC student support and constitute an important aspect of graduate training under the guidance of the UCSC faculty.
 
## Teaching Assistant Contracts

The Teaching Assistants (TAs) mentioned above, are covered by a union negotiated, system-wide contract that includes (in addition to a salary of just over $2400/month):

- A waiver of tuition, plus a $300 campus fee remission
- 3% annual wage increases (in line with other University employees)
- A childcare subsidy of $3,300 per year (unique to TAs)
- A one-time signing bonus, and
- A complete remission of any health care premiums

## New Programs

At face value, this is a strong package, but there are aspects of it that make it difficult for our students. Most importantly, Teaching Assistantships can lack financial security and predictability—to date, these Teaching Assistantships have not been guaranteed for the length of a typical program. This, combined with the high cost of housing, can make it difficult for student to budget over their time here at UCSC. 
 
Recognizing this challenge, Chancellor Larive in January announced two new programs to provide doctoral and MFA students with greater financial security and predictability:
 
- __5-year/50% Support Packages:__ Beginning in fall 2020, UCSC will offer new and continuing doctoral students support packages for five years (2 years for MFA students). These packages will have a minimum level of support equivalent to that of a 50 percent teaching assistantship.
- __$2500 Housing Supplement:__ Until more graduate student housing becomes available, an annual housing supplement for doctoral and MFA students offered through the Graduate Division. 
 
Together, these programs cost approximately $7 million per year.
 
- __Temporary Housing Assistance Programs:__ As both of those programs are slated to begin in fall, Chancellor Larive also introduced a bridge measure to support students who need help now. Offered through Slug Support, these programs help cover gaps in rent and other housing related costs as well as providing security deposit assistance.
